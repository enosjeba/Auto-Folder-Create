# Folder Bag

### What is this project ?
FolderBag is a software which will help you create a project folder and multiple folder's inside it in a few clicks. This will save you time and boost your starting speed for the longest standing idea in your mind.

### Why this project exist?
Every time we try to start off with a idea from our mind, We generally go through the process of creating multiple folders based on our execution. A creative would be creating folder for his / her footages, png's and all the other elements included. Likewise a coder would be creating files based on the language he would be using. No matter whatever the project is we all end up creating a bunch of new folder every now and then! So I tried to automate this process and share it with everyone.

### How to use?
Copy the exe file to the desired location to create folders. Double click exe file and you will know the rest. I am also working on making it more easily accesible!

### What has happened ?
For now I have been able to just make the basic app which can get you started by creating folders in simple clicks. In future I am planning to include Folder Templates so you can keep your own set of folder names on the shelf and activate it in lesser time.
